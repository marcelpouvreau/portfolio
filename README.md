# portfolio

HELLO

This is my portfolio,

i worked on it with php and symfony as framework
for the css i used pure csss, creating a link for each template, that helped me to find my self easier if i needed to change anything.

I created a back-office for my own to be able to add new works during the time and to prove my self that i can do it.

I tried to keep it simple but usefull.
